                    <h3>Automatic recording</h3>
                <p>With the new location-based automatic function, forgetting about time recording is a thing of the past!</p>
                <p>Simply deposit your workstations for each job and you're done.<br />myWork does the rest for you!</p>
          			<p>A workplace is always a region within the defined radius. As soon as you enter or leave the region, myWork receives a message from your device and reacts to it.</p>
                <p class="text-muted">Note: For technical reasons, the message will not be sent immediately. Depending on the device, it may take several minutes.</p>
                <h5>Choosing the Radius and Adjustment</h5>
                <img src="img-tipps/myWork/Arbeitsplatz-en.png" class="section-header-image"  alt=""> 
                <p>If you work on a larger company site or have to switch between different buildings during your working hours, you should choose a large radius accordingly. You can move freely within the radius during your entire working day without myWork stamping you out.</p>
                <p>However, to record your working time as accurately as possible, you can use the correction sliders to define when the clock should actually start or stop running.</p>
                <h6>Example:</h6>
                <p>Your parking space is about 200m away from your workplace, as is the changing room. Place the pin in the center (keep your finger pressed on the map) and set the radius so that your working area is completely covered, here approx. 200m.</p>
                <p>In addition, you enter approx. +2 min. at Start and approx. -3 min. at End via the correction sliders. </p>
                <p>If you now enter the parking lot, myWork will notify you that your time recording will start in two minutes. If you leave the car park again after work, the three minutes will be deducted from the end date.</p>
                </br>
                <h6>Tip: Try a few days to find the right configuration for you!</h6>

                      <p>Now clearer and with more quick functions.</p>
                      <h5>Fast editing of activities</h5>
                      <p>You can now easily edit your recorded working time in the tab "Activities" in just a few steps. <b>Swipe to the right to book a time entry</b>. You can recognize the successful booking by the green highlight below the job icon. <b>Swiping to the left deletes the recorded time.</b> The entry is then automatically removed from the overview. <b>If you hold down an already recorded time for a long time, it duplicates itself and the date adjusts itself intelligently.</b> For example, you can enter a "standard workday" without actively tracking it.</p>

                      <h5>Intelligent filtering of activities</h5>   
                      <p><b>You will find the filter in the upper right corner.</b> At initial opening, your active jobs are already preselected. You can tell by the orange border. <b>All other (deactivated) jobs become visible when scrolling to the left.</b> Additionally you have the option to choose between all, pending or booked activities within the selected job(s). The default always selects all activities.<br /><b>The timeline allows you to customize the time period individually.</b> When selecting the pre-defined periods ("This week", "Last week", etc.), the date and all associated entries are automatically adjusted.<br /> A <b>click on the arrow</b> next to the filter symbol hides the filter area around it and creates space.</p>

                      <p>Your recorded <b>Working time</b> and the resulting <b>Income</b> in the area below the table are adjusted to the filter criteria you have selected.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Click the filter icon again to reset all filters. </p>
